                  The Ada "Standard Generic Library" (SGL)

                           Version 2.0 alpha 2

                             July 11th, 1997

The Ada SGL is a port of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

*** HISTORY ***

Version 1.0 : Prototype SGL system created as part of a class taught
              by professor David R. Musser at RPI, by Ulfar Erlingsson
              (ulfar@cs.cornell.edu) and Alexander V. Konstantinou.
              A paper discussing the first version is available at the URL:

                     ftp://ftp.cs.rpi.edu/pub/stl/stl2ada.ps


Version 2.0a1 : Pursued as a master's project by Alexander V. Konstantinou
                under the supervision of professor David R. Musser

                Added allocators, Re-implemented vectors, lists, added
                trees, sets, and maps, new algorithms, new adaptors ...

Version 2.0a2 : Pursued as a personal project by Alexander V. Konstantinou
                and David R. Musser.

                Added Constant_Iterators, Reverse_Iterators, container
                signatures ...

Future : Add missing algorithms, deques, and freeze the library API

*** HOW TO GET IT ***

The latest version of SGL is available at the URL:

        ftp://ftp.cs.rpi.edu/pub/stl/SGL.tar.gz

Version 2.0a2 of the Ada SGL is available at the URL:

        ftp://ftp.cs.rpi.edu/pub/stl/SGL-2.0a2.tar.gz


*** REQUIREMENTS ***

The current release of the Ada SGL has only been tested on version 3.09
of GNAT (AdaCore Technologies).  In particular, we have successfully
compiled using GNAT 3.09 on Linux (ELF), Solaris 2.5.1, and Windows 95.  
As you will notice from comments in the code, SGL triggers several 
unresolved GNAT bugs which required some working around.  In a couple 
of instances, we had to comment out part of the code 
(see sgl-map_signatures.ads).

GNAT is available at the URL:

        ftp://ftp.cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat/

The AdaCore Technologies home page is at the URL:

        http://www.gnat.com/

We welcome feedback from users of other Ada 95 compilers, especially since
we do not have access to them!

*** HOW TO INSTALL IT ***

Un-archive the distribution using :

        gunzip -c SGL-2.0a2.tar.gz | tar xvf -

which will create the directory SGL-2.0a2 with two subdirectories "SGL"
and "test".  The "SGL" directory contains the Ada SGL packages, while
the "test" directory contains test programs for some of the SGL
components.  To compile the test programs do:

        cd test
        make

You may have to modify the Makefile if "gnatmake" is not in your path.
